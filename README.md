Project Name: "DeepImageReconstructor"

Description:
"DeepImageReconstructor" is a deep learning project that utilizes an autoencoder to reconstruct images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The autoencoder is trained on the dataset, and then it is used to generate reconstructed images from the test set. The project demonstrates the power of autoencoders in learning meaningful representations of images and their ability to reconstruct images with high fidelity.

The project includes code that loads the CIFAR-100 dataset, preprocesses the data, builds and trains the autoencoder model, and visualizes the original and reconstructed images. The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

The "DeepImageReconstructor" project serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in image reconstruction using autoencoders and can be used as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation with different datasets and architectures.
